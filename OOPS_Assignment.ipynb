        "4. Method Resolution Order (MRO):\n",
        "\n",
        "(A).In cases of multiple inheritance, super() uses the MRO to determine the order in which methods are called from different parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "(B).This ensures that methods are called in a consistent and predictable manner, following the order of resolution specified by the classes involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Forward Compatibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "(A).super() provides a layer of indirection, which makes the code more forward-compatible.\n",
        "\n",
        "(B).This means that the code is less likely to break if the inheritance hierarchy is modified in the future."

        "\n",
        "1. Resource Cleanup:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Garbage Collection:\n",
        "Python's garbage collector manages memory automatically. When an object is no longer referenced, the garbage collector reclaims its memory. The __del__ method is called during this process, just before the object is removed from memory.\n",

        "3. Unpredictable Timing:\n",
        "It's important to note that the exact timing of when __del__ is called is unpredictable. This is because the garbage collector runs periodically and may not be triggered immediately when an object becomes unreferenced.\n",

        "4. Not for General Deletion:\n",
        "The __del__ method is not for deleting objects in general. The del keyword in Python reduces the reference count of an object, and the object will be garbage collected when its reference count reaches zero."
