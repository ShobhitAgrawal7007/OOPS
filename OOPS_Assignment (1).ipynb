        " Breakdown of its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Resource Cleanup:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Garbage Collection:\n",
        "Python's garbage collector manages memory automatically. When an object is no longer referenced, the garbage collector reclaims its memory. The __del__ method is called during this process, just before the object is removed from memory.\n",

        "4. Not for General Deletion:\n",
        "The __del__ method is not for deleting objects in general. The del keyword in Python reduces the reference count of an object, and the object will be garbage collected when its reference count reaches zero."
